# Voting Reform

Voting Reform is a work-in-progress hypothetical simulation of a proportional voting system for the UK General Elections.

## Aims

To test the hypothesis that the current system of First-Past-The-Post voting leads to a less representative government than one chosen by Alternative Vote or Single Transferable Vote.

## Current Implementation

In infancy - nothing works.

## Future Plans

Voting Reform will be based on the [STV for Westminster](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~denis/stv4uk/schedule.pdf) paper authored Denis Mollison of Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh in 2010. It will simulate how the UK General Election outcome would be different under FPTP (first-past-the-post, current system), AV (alternative vote, [rejected at referendum in 2011](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Alternative_Vote_referendum,_2011)), and STV (single transferable vote).
